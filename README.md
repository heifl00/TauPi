# TauPi
This is the repository for our project called "TauPi".

TauPi is a project which originated from a project work at the University of Applied Sciences Leipzig in the module "Numerical Methods in Mechanics" with Prof. Lenzen.
TauPi is a software programmed in Mikropython. Running TauPi on a Raspberry Pi Pico W with a connected BME280 breakout from Pimoroni (compare hardware schematic), the system serves as a mold monitor.

The document main.py is the main document on the Raspberry Pi Pico W.
